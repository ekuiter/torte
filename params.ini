# evaluated (#)SAT solvers
# due to license issues, we do not upload solver binaries. all binaries were compiled/downloaded from http://www.satcompetition.org, https://github.com/sat-heritage/docker-images, or the download page of the respective solver
# we choose all winning SAT solvers in SAT competitions
# for #SAT, we choose the five fastest solvers as evaluated by Sundermann et al. 2021, found here: https://github.com/SoftVarE-Group/emse21-evaluation-sharpsat/tree/main/solvers
