# This experiment prepares a new release of the tool for uploading on GitHub.
# Builds and collects all Docker images, each of which can be uploaded individually.
# (to circumvent GitHub 2 GiB file limit for releases, and to allow users to only select the images they need).
# Make sure to run this on a Linux machine (not macOS) to make sure the images are built for the linux/amd64 platform.
# The built images are collected in the 'release' directory, together with a copy of the tool distribution.
# To load any of these images on a fresh system (instead of building them from scratch), just place the .tar.gz files in the tool directory (besides the README.md file).
# Using this mechanism ensures the best reproducibility that is possible in our context:
# Given an experiment file, a tool distribution, and all necessary Docker images, the exact experiment environment can be recreated.
# No additional internet connection is needed, only a basic working environment that fulfills the requirements sketched in the README.md file.
