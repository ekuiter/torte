# model-counting evaluation

* todo: adapt readme from ASE'22 repo
* maybe re-add ASE and FM repo params configuration, also re-adding hierarchies and SAT solvers
* make configurable which cnf transformation is used for which source (currently only kcr - kcr, and kcl - z3, and no fide)
* make prepare_linux_repository.sh and extract.sh read its configuration from params.ini as well (single source of configuration)
